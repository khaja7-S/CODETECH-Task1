Here's an overview of a simple calculator project using Python:

Project Overview: Simple Calculator
Objective
Create a command-line-based calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Features
Basic Operations:
Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
User Input:
Prompt users for two numbers and the desired operation.
Error Handling:
Handle invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values).
Handle division by zero gracefully.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Environment: Any Python environment (local installation, Jupyter Notebook, etc.)
Implementation Steps
Set Up Environment: Ensure Python is installed and set up.
Design the Calculator:
Create functions for each operation (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
User Interface:
Use input statements to gather user input.
Display results clearly.
Error Handling:
Implement try-except blocks to manage exceptions.
Loop for Continuous Operation:
Allow users to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit.
Testing
Validate the calculator with various inputs to ensure accuracy.
Test edge cases, such as division by zero and invalid inputs.
Future Enhancements
Implement additional functions (e.g., exponentiation, square root).
Create a graphical user interface (GUI) using libraries like Tkinter.
Allow for more complex mathematical expressions.
